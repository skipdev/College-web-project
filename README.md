# Ela's Beauty Room
This is a website created for a co-worker of mine, Ela. She needed a new website to promote her beauty business.
<br />
I decided to create this for my final college project, however, the website was made using a HTML template which can be found at https://html5up.net/arcana.
This is due to the fact that I was not yet fully confident in creating websites, however, since then I have definitely improved and can now create well-designed websites without the 
use of a template.
